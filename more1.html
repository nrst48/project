            <h1>We Saw, We Sat, We Reviewed: The Most Comfortable Sofas at Article</h1> <br>
 
            <p>
                There’s something interesting happening in the furniture world: a plentiful crop of online-only, direct-to-consumer retailers are popping up everywhere, offering incredibly good looking (and often much more competitively priced) merchandise with the caveat that you need to purchase sight unseen. With something as large of a commitment as a sofa, it might be easy to hesitate on taking the plunge, regardless of the upsides (quick shipping, generous return policies, modern styling, budget pricing). One of these companies (that you asked for enthusiastically in the comments of our introductory Sofa Squad post earlier this year) is Article.

                A little info about Article:
Formerly Bryght, Article is an online-only, direct-to-consumer company that offers modern furniture for the living room, bedroom, dining room and beyond. They don’t have any showrooms, traditional sales associates or other middle men, so they can pass on the savings to the consumer. You’ll get a generous 30-day return policy, $49 flat rate shipping to your door and the ability to order swatches as needed.
